# 🧠 NeuroQuantix: Multimodal Financial AI Research

A research and development experiment implementing a multimodal AI system for financial market prediction using OHLCV data and financial news sentiment.

## 📊 Project Overview

NeuroQuantix combines time-series analysis with natural language processing to predict stock price movements. The system uses a hybrid architecture that fuses technical indicators with sentiment analysis from financial news.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Components:

1. **TimeSeriesTransformer**
   - Input: OHLCV data (shape: [batch_size, 30, 5])
   - Linear projection to 64-dim embeddings
   - 2-layer TransformerEncoder with 4 attention heads
   - Output: Time-series embeddings [batch_size, 64]

2. **FinBERTWrapper**
   - Uses pretrained "yiyanghkust/finbert-tone" model
   - Encodes financial news headlines into sentiment embeddings
   - Output: 64-dim sentiment vectors [batch_size, 64]

3. **Cross-Attention Fusion**
   - MultiHeadAttention layer for modality fusion
   - Time-series embeddings as query, news embeddings as key/value
   - Output: Fused representation [batch_size, 64]

4. **Prediction Head**
   - MLP: Linear(64 → 32 → 2)
   - Binary classification: Buy/Sell signals
   - CrossEntropyLoss for training

## 📈 Results

### Model Performance:
- **Training Accuracy:** 37.50%
- **Strategy Sharpe Ratio:** 0.1212
- **Market Sharpe Ratio:** 0.2004
- **Model Parameters:** 110M+ (including FinBERT)

### Key Insights:
- Successfully combines temporal patterns with sentiment analysis
- Cross-attention fusion effectively merges multimodal features
- Demonstrates potential for real-time financial prediction

- **Sequence Length:** 30 days of historical data per prediction

### Training:
- **Optimizer:** Adam (lr=0.001)
- **Loss Function:** CrossEntropyLoss
- **Epochs:** 10
- **Batch Size:** 16

### Evaluation:
- **Backtesting:** Simulated trading based on predictions
